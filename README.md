Hi 👋 My name is KENNETH 
===========================================

Engineer III / Senior Engineer
------------------------------

Still curious and excited to learn new techniques or tools after a decade of programming software in the backend and some in the front end web UI using a mix of JVM languages and JavaScript

* 🌍  I'm based in London
* 🖥️  See my portfolio at [Github](http://github.com/ManiacViper)
* 🚀  I'm currently working on [nostalgic recall (music app)](http://github.com/ManiacViper/nostalgic-recall)
* 🧠  I'm learning db and cache cluster design based on ratio of read writes
* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on anything that will help my day to day life
* ⚡  learning actual human languages also interest me
